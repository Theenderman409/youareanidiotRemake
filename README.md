# You Are An Idiot
<p>In case you didnt know Microsoft is retiring Internet Explorer on June 15, 2022. This means you will no longer have support for "You Are An Idiot"</p>
You have to have your Pop-Up Blocker off and your Autoplayer On, meaning anyone whom visits the site will not enjoy the full experience.

# How to turn off Pop-Up Blocker
<p>Now i'm giving you only how to do this for this site.</p> **DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR POP-UP BLOCKER FOR EVERYTHING!!!**
<p>Yes I mean it</p>
<p>When you first open our site a little red box will appear up in the far Right of your Navigation Bar. 'Click on it > Allow For This Site > Done' </p>
<p>Upon completion more images will apear and move around (some may appear fullscreen I am working on fixing this)</p>

# How to allow audio
<p> This will only work if I do it for all websites </p>
<p> edge://settings/content/mediaAutoplay > Limit > Allow </p>

# Final Notes
<p>I will make this as easy to use as possible and will be fixing many bugs, but for now have a fun!!!</p>


### Warning & Alerts
<p> Putting this on someone elses computer without their awarness is not recommended as many computers may not have the resources to handle this</p>
<p>This only creates a bunch of Pop-Ups nothing else</p>
<p> This is not offical it is only a remake</p>
